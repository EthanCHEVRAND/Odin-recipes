    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This French bread recipe yields hot, fresh loaves with a crisp, crunchy crust and slightly chewy center. This bread is as traditional as the bread served in France.</p>

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornmeal</li>
        <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 ½ (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 egg white</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Grease a large baking sheet and sprinkle with cornmeal. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Stir in 2 cups warm water; beat with the dough hook attachment until blended. Continue adding remaining flour, a little at a time, until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Shape into a ball, place in a greased bowl, and turn once.</li>
        <li>Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down and divide in half.</li>
        <li>Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll each half into a large rectangle. Roll up, starting from a long side. Moisten edge with water and seal. Taper ends.</li>
        <li>Place loaves, seam-side down, on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Lightly beat egg white with 1 tablespoon water and brush over loaves.</li>
        <li>Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until nearly doubled, 35 to 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to make 3 or 4 diagonal cuts, about 1/4-inch deep, across top of each loaf.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush loaves with egg white mixture.</li>
        <li>Continue baking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 190 degrees F (88 degrees C) or loaves sound hollow when tapped, 15 to 20 minutes more. If necessary, cover loosely with foil to prevent over-browning.</li>
        <li>Remove loaves from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
