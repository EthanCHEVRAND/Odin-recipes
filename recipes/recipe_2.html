    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Magic happens when sugar, almond flour, and airy egg whites come together in perfect harmony to form the delicate disks the French call macarons. Follow this step-by-step guide and what goes on in those patisseries will no longer be a mystery! Store macarons in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</p>

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup blanched almond flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>3 egg whites, room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ cup superfine sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 drops gel food coloring</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Buttercream</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine confectioners' sugar, almond flour, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse a few times until extra-fine. Sift through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat egg whites with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until frothy. Gradually add superfine sugar and vanilla and continue to beat on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Do not overbeat; tips of peaks should hold their shape but curl over slightly.</li>
        <li>Gently fold 1/3 of the almond flour mixture into the egg whites, turning bowl occasionally, until nearly combined. Drop in food coloring. Add remaining almond flour mixture in 2 additions, gently folding until a batter comes together. Batter should fall off the spatula in thick ribbons without breaking.</li>
        <li>Transfer batter to a piping bag with a #804 pastry tip. Line 2 light-colored baking sheets with silicone macaron mats. Pipe batter into each circle on the mats. Tap baking sheets 4 times against the counter to release any air bubbles. Let macarons sit at room temperature until dry to the touch, 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake macarons in the preheated oven until bottoms rise slightly off the mats to form 'feet', 17 to 20 minutes. Switch baking sheets positions halfway through.</li>
        <li>Let macarons cool on the mats for 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, beat butter and confectioners' sugar together using an electric mixer until creamy. Add heavy cream and vanilla extract; beat until combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer buttercream to a piping bag with a #4 pastry tip. Pipe buttercream onto 1/2 of the macarons. Top with the other halves to create sandwiches.</li>
    </ol>
